                    What is the difference between .map(), .forEach(), .filter(), and .find()? </p>

                <p> There are many key difference between .map(), .forEach(), .filter(), and .find(). Every developer should know about this in order to do his work perfectly.</p>

                    <br>
                    <li class="text-xl font-semibold">.forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. </li>
                    
                    <br>
                    <li class="text-xl font-semibold">.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.</li>
                  
                    <br>
                    <li class="text-xl font-semibold">.find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail — this function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return the first that has matched.</li>

                    What is the difference between Local Storage, Section Storage, Cookies?</p>

                <p class=" text-xl font-bold  py-2 underline underline-offset-8">Answer:</p>
                <p> Differences are given bellow: </p>
                <br>
                <li class="text-xl font-semibold">Storage Limit
                </li>
                <p>Local Storage stores up to 10 megabytes and Session storage stores up to 5 megabytes. On the other hand, these provide a very restrictive and small storage capacity of 4 kilobytes for Cookies.</p>
                <br>
                <li class="text-xl font-semibold">Accessibility</li>
                <p>If we talk about it, since session storage is tied to the particular session and each tab has its session, data is only available in the current tab in which we’ve set the session storage data. Lastly, cookies are somewhat similar to local storage as they are accessible from any window or tab. It could also be accessed on the server</p>
                <br>
                <li class="text-xl font-semibold">Expiration</li>
                <p>Session storage stores data only for a session, meaning that the data is stored until the browser (or tab) is closed, for Local Storage it have to delete manually and for cookies can be updated , set using document.cookie object from browser window object.</p>

                    What is event loop? How does it work?  </p>
                <p class="font-bold text-xl py-2 underline underline-offset-8">Answer :</p>
                <p>Definition: <br>
                    The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures,it gives us the illusion of multi-threading </p> <br>
                    <p>Working method:</p>
                    <p>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.</p>

                <p class="text-2xl font-bold m-10 underline underline-offset-8">quizTimer Function Explain:</p>
                <p>In this function quizTimer is taking dismiss as a parameter. Inside the function if the dismiss is true it will return clearInterval(timer). When dismiss is false timer starts a new function named setInterval(). This is a callback function which will run in every 1000 milliseconds (1 second). Inside the function the countHtml is taking the counted minutes and seconds based on the variable. The minutes and seconds are will show 0 if necessary. In the end, inside of countHtml.innerHTML there is a conditional statement, where count is grater than 60. If count is even number it removes a class </p>

            <div>
                <p class="text-2xl font-bold m-10 underline underline-offset-8">chooseQuiz Function Explain:</p>
                <p>
                    The function chooseQuiz has two parameters index and a given answer. It checks whether the answer
                    already exists for the quiz or not. <br>

                    If it does, it replaces the old answer with
                    the new one. If it doesn't, it adds a new answer to the answers array. <br>

                    The answers array is then passed to the displayAnswers function, which displays the current
                    answers to the user.

                    Thats all.
